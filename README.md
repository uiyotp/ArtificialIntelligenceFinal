# Artificial Intelligence Final
Final project for CompSci 332.  We need to come up with a project name and idea.
## Basic Information
>By: Solomon Paprocki and Trent *What is your last name?*

Language used: Java

Also give a name to your project to help differentiate it from other submissions (so we don't have a dozen groups presenting "Semester Project").

## Minimum Viable Product

>The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the core set of functionality that defines your project.  Without the content in the MVP, your project would not be considered complete.  List all of the features which your project must contain.  You might find it helpful to write these in the form of "user stories".  These should be features which you are confident you can deliver in the time available.  However, they must be complex enough to warrant a project grade.  Your MVP must contain all of the criteria listed in the assignment file.  Delivering your MVP as-promised is worth 70% of the project grade.

## Stretch Goals
>Your project must define at least 3 stretch goals.  These are features which would be nice to have in your final deliverable, but are not integral to the completeness of the project.  Typically, these will involve learning outside of the classroom.  These must be related to AI.  Projects can have as many stretch goals as you can come up with, but only the 3 most-complete ones will count for credit.  It is to your benefit to define a large number of stretch goals.  Each acceptably completed stretch goal is worth 10% of the project grade, up to 30% total for delivering at least 3.  Don't be afraid to include some longshot stretch goals!

## Timeline
>Project Submissions are due on the day of our final exam period.  Include a timeline of where you want your project to be week-by-week until the due date.  This helps you set realistic goals and portion out your work appropriately.  Proposals are due by March 12 at 11:59pm.

## Group Roles
>If members of your group are going to be responsible for individual components of your project, include those roles here.  If not, describe how you are going to coordinate your development.
