# Dots and Boxes
>Final project for CompSci 332: Intro to Artificial Intelligence
## Basic Information
>By: Solomon Paprocki and Trent Purinton
>Language used: Java
## Minimum Viable Product
>As a user, I want to be able to interact with the dots and boxes grid (Make moves)
>As a user, I want to have an AI play a move against me (Moves can be played against them by computer)
>As a user, I want at least a 2x2 box grid to play games on
>As a user, I want a graphical user interface to interact with
>As a user, I want a menu with a start button to start the game
>As a user, I want a settings that can configure game options (for example, the stretch goals)
>As a developer, I want the AI to choose the best move every turn (working AI)
## Stretch Goals
>As a user, I want to be able to play on multiple grids, such as a 3x3 grid as well (expansion of the AI)
>As a developer, I want to create an AI that can play on up to a 5x5 box grid (Additional expansion to include 4x4 and 5x5)
>As a user, I want a game mode that shows what the computers next move will be (Practice Mode)
>As a user, I want to be able to play with a friend and the computer (3 player Game Mode)
>Your project must define at least 3 stretch goals.  These are features which would be nice to have in your final deliverable, but are not integral to the completeness of the project.  Typically, these will involve learning outside of the classroom.  These must be related to AI.  Projects can have as many stretch goals as you can come up with, but only the 3 most-complete ones will count for credit.  It is to your benefit to define a large number of stretch goals.  Each acceptably completed stretch goal is worth 10% of the project grade, up to 30% total for delivering at least 3.  Don't be afraid to include some longshot stretch goals!
## Timeline
>Week of 3/16: Start the development of AI and figure out how to create a GUI for the game
>Week of 3/23: Finish programming the AI with the rules of the game and get a GUI outline for the game ready
>Week of 3/30: Finish up the original version of the AI and integrate it into the GUI
>Week of 4/6: Configure AI to work on 3x3 grids and work on a menu with start and settings options for GUI
>Week of 4/13: Finish up AI work on larger grids, figure out expanding grids on the GUI
>Week of 4/20: Start figuring out how to implement practice mode and integrate the GUI with the larger grid options
>Week of 4/27: Finsih up programming practice mode and figure out how the GUI will display the next move
>Week of 5/4: Create 3 player game mode and tidy up the settings and the rest of the GUI
>Week of 5/11: Make sure every works as expected, fix any issues, and get ready to present project
## Group Roles
>Solomon Paprocki: Leads the development of the Artificial Intelligence aspect of the game.
>Trent Purinton: Leads the development of the Graphical User Interface aspect of the game.
