# Dots and Boxes
>Final project for CompSci 332: Intro to Artificial Intelligence
## Basic Information
>By: Solomon Paprocki and Trent Purinton

>Language used: Java
## Minimum Viable Product
>As a user, I want to be able to interact with the dots and boxes grid (Make moves)

>As a user, I want to have an AI play a move against me (Moves can be played against them by computer)

>As a user, I want at least a 2x2 box grid to play games on

>As a user, I want a graphical user interface to interact with

>As a user, I want a menu with a start button to start the game

>As a user, I want a settings that can configure game options (for example, the stretch goals)

>As a developer, I want the AI to choose the best move every turn (working AI)
## Stretch Goals
>As a user, I want to be able to play on larger grids, such as a 3x3 grid as well (expansion of the AI)

>As a user, I want a game mode that shows what the computers next move will be (Practice Mode)

>As a user, I want to be able to play with a friend and the computer (3 player Game Mode)

>As a user, I want to play on whatever size grid I want (Configure AI to handle any size grid and add the option in settings)

>As a user, I want a difficulty setting so that I don't always lose (Add difficulties in the settings)

>As a user, I want variance in the AI so that it doesn't always make the same move (Best move variance)

>As a developer, I want to implement Alpha-Beta pruning in order to have a more effiecient AI (add Alpha-Beta Pruning)
## Timeline
>Week of 3/16: Start the development of AI and figure out how to create a GUI for the game

>Week of 3/23: Finish programming the AI with the rules of the game and get a GUI outline for the game ready

>Week of 3/30: Finish up the original version of the AI and integrate it into the GUI

>Week of 4/6: Configure AI to work on 3x3 grids and work on a menu with start and settings options for GUI

>Week of 4/13: Finish up AI work on larger grids(maybe even any size grid), figure out expanding grids on the GUI

>Week of 4/20: Start figuring out how to implement practice mode and integrate the GUI with the larger grid options

>Week of 4/27: Finsih up programming practice mode and figure out how the GUI will display the next move

>Week of 5/4: Create 3 player game mode and tidy up the settings and the rest of the GUI

>Week of 5/11: Make sure every works as expected, fix any issues, and get ready to present project
## Group Roles
>Solomon Paprocki: Leads the development of the Artificial Intelligence aspect of the game.

>Trent Purinton: Leads the development of the Graphical User Interface aspect of the game.
