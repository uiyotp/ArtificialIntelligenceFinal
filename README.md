# Dots and Boxes
>Final project for CompSci 332: Intro to Artificial Intelligence
## Basic Information
>By: Solomon Paprocki and Trent Purinton

>Language used: Java
## Minimum Viable Product
>As a user, I want to be able to interact with the dots and boxes grid (Make moves)

>As a user, I want to have an AI play a move against me (Moves can be played against them by computer)

>As a user, I want at least a 2x2 box grid to play games on

>As a user, I want a graphical user interface to interact with

>As a user, I want a menu with a start button to start the game

>As a user, I want a settings that can configure game options (for example, the stretch goals)

>As a developer, I want the AI to choose the best move every turn (working AI)
## Stretch Goals
>As a user, I want to be able to play on larger grids, such as a 3x3 grid as well (expansion of the AI)

>As a user, I want a game mode that shows what the computers next move will be (Practice Mode)

>As a user, I want to be able to play with a friend and the computer (3 player Game Mode)

>As a user, I want to play on whatever size grid I want (Configure AI to handle any size grid and add the option in settings)

>As a user, I want a difficulty setting so that I don't always lose (Add difficulties in the settings)

>As a user, I want variance in the AI so that it doesn't always make the same move (Best move variance)

>As a developer, I want to implement Alpha-Beta pruning in order to have a more effiecient AI (add Alpha-Beta Pruning)
## Timeline
>Week of 4/6: Create the game rules to implement into MiniMax and get a GUI outline for the game ready

>Week of 4/13: Finish the MiniMax Algorithm and finish basic GUI

>Week of 4/20: Integrate the GUI into the game and implement Alpha-Beta Pruning

>Week of 4/27: Create Start Menu for the game and program difficulty settings into the program

>Week of 5/4: Create and implement a settings tab on the GUI, include game difficulties.  Also, implement variance.

>Week of 5/11: Make sure every works as expected, fix any issues
## Group Roles
>Solomon Paprocki: Leads the development of the Artificial Intelligence aspect of the game.

>Trent Purinton: Leads the development of the Graphical User Interface aspect of the game.
